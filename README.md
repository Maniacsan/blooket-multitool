# Blooket Multitool
Orginal creater is [Basil](https://www.gbasil.dev/).

![Thyme is shutting down!
Hey everyone!


Recently, Ben (the creator/owner/lead developer of Blooket, a very rad man) asked me to take down my cheat suite for Blooket. I fully respect that decision, as I was expecting it sooner or later. It's a bit of a relief, because it's one more thing I don't have to worry about, and I get to work on some other cool projects.


Please don't harass Ben about this. I understand some of you might be a bit ticked off or sad to see this shut down, but I fully understand and respect Ben's reasoning.


If you have any questions, DON'T EMAIL ME. You can join my Discord server if you have questions, but I won't be bringing this tool back. If you have the multitool archived somewhere, I'd recommend removing it. Ben's working on a full rewrite of the backend to prevent cheating, and will continue honing his anticheat, so you're only putting your account at risk.


If you want to read about the evolution of this cheat, read this blog post.
